# Breaking Bad


This art was actually for my Chemistry teacher. In like end of 11th grade a new chemistry teacher joined. He just taught us Organic but man he made me actually understand it rather than mugging up. He sparked in me a new interest for Chemistry. He was more than a mentor to me than a teacher. I started taking it seriously and now I absolutely love that subject. So I made this for him as a birthday gift :smile:
