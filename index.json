After reading this checkout the rest of the Posts too SSB Stories Tip “Recommended till not recommended!\" - Chest No. 1 From 8th Feb - 12th Feb 2021 I was in 1-AFSB Dehradun. It was crazy. The preparation that I did for this moment, the crazy first-time experience in SSB, the friends that I made, all the mastis, read all about that in this Blog. Feel free to skip and move on using the Table of Contents. Day - 0: The Preparation From the time I was a 12 year old 9th-Grade boy, I wanted to be in Indian Air-Force as a Pilot. Not just any Pilot, a Fighter-Pilot. Coming from a military background, this was a no-brainer. Seeing planes fly past zillion of times, it was natural. So, by the time I was 16 year old, I was completely sure that I wanted to join the NDA - National Defence Academy, the premier defence institute which trains all future officers in Indian Defence Forces. Added to the fact that I lived in such an environment where all my friends also dreamt the same dream, hyped me up.

Few of us friends, living in different parts of the country, decided to meet everyday in Skype early in the morning. Thus the journey of our preparation started from the month of May itself. We started out with basics, each day we would do 1 set of PPDT - Picture Perception Description Test. At first it took us a lot of time to write a story, and the story we wrote was well exceeding the time limit. But it was fun. We slowly reduced our timings and honed our skills and were getting better every day. Plus, meeting with friends - only if virtually - was refreshing.

We just started to prepare once again for the SSB. New friends came and went still we met almost always in the morning. See, everything is available in the internet if you look hard enough. All these coaching institutes are worthless. All you need is a goal and desire to achieve that, and you won’t need to spend a dime on this coaching institutes Sure enough, we got all we needed to practice and prepare. There are so many PPDT and TAT - Thematic appreciation test, pictures available in the internet. Same goes for WAT - Word Association Test. You will get all the details for SD - Self Description and PIQ - Personal Information Questionnaire. For OIR - Officer Intelligence Rating, bank logical reasoning questions are sufficient. In short, everything is available in the internet. Day - 1: Screen-In After all this preparation, we were stoked and eager to go to SSB. I was assigned 1-AFSB Dehradun. I went all on my own for the first time. I took a train and reached Dehradun around 2100 hrs on the 7th Feb. Checked-in in a motel and was in a crazy mode for the rest of the night man! Next morning, woke up early morning, still managed to get late (we were asked to reach between 0600 hrs to 0645 hrs) and reached the 1-AFSB almost as the gates were closing. Talk about a close call!

We were made to stand in a queue and our temperature and covid negative report was checked. Few other documents were also collected there only. After this we were asked to leave our luggage in a big storage room except for water bottle, sanitizer and pen. Then came the wait. After a small briefing of general Do’s and Dont’s we were made to sit in a large hanger (big roofed area with 3 side walls) for almost an hour. The nerves were getting upon me and made me so restless. After what seemed like an eternity, at around 8 we were given a small package in which a bread with little cheese inside and a piece of cutlet was there. I was too scared at that time to even notice the taste. I just gulped it down. After this again we were made to sit for another hour. The nerves were getting all time high and I was getting jittery.

Call it nerves, call it never-seen-before type of questions, call it whatever. The fact is, I panicked. Even then, I calmed myself and almost completed the paper save for 2 questions.

The picture we were shown was crystal clear, far easier than what I had practised. There were two college students in the foreground, a boy and girl. There was a watchman in the background and another boy who was waving from behind. The background looked like the front of a College. Call it nerves but again I got carried away and was not able to complete the story in the 4 minutes of time. Heck, I didn’t have a concrete story in my mind. By the time 14 of us were taken to a different shed and made to sit down in a semi-circular pattern facing the Psychologist, GTO and the IO, I had changed my story 4 times in my head. But like a cliche Bollywood picture, at the very last moment I had made what I thought was a pretty good story. The story I made was something like this: Abstract Those two are friends in a college and their exams had just finished. They were planning to go to some place for their summer vacation. The boy in the back meets with them and after hearing about their plan, suggest that they should instead go to an old age home and spend a day with them. They then organise everything about the event and have a nice day with them. This was basically the plot of my story and I narrated it pretty confidently when my time came.

I had some naive thoughts like, people would be hesitating to start the discussion, how I would jump in as the initiator and we would have a good and productive discussion considering we all were freshers. I couldn’t have been more wrong. As soon as the last candidate (chest no. 14) narrated his story, it was a fish market. Each and every one of us started speaking. No one was stopping to listen to other’s stories. I was speaking and spitting out points and trying to steer the group to my story but to no avail. People simply were not listening. Added to the fact that due to covid precaution we were made to sit in a big circle so soon enough the first 7 candidates were doing their own discussion while the rest seven of us were trying to make our points heard including me. It was a total chaos. Tring! Tring! Seeing our eagerly participation and the officers not able to understand a thing, they divided our groups into two groups of 7 each and gave a minute or two for each group to discuss on our own. This was the moment that I shined. As soon as our groups' turn came, I spoke first, gave 2 - 3 good points and steered our group towards my story. There was a Chest No. - 9 who also participated lively in the discussion and spoke good points. Tring! Tring! After a minute of discussion by each sub-group, we were asked to discuss as a whole once again. Again chaos erupted, however this time it was a somewhat controlled chaos. I made few other points. Chest No. - 5 somehow listened to my points and actually said that we should follow my points. That was a huge plus point for him I think in the accessors' eyes. Tring! Tring! The accessors then asked one of us to narrate our common story. Chest No. - 4 immediately stood up and asked to narrate the story but since none of us had elected him, the accessors made him sit down. Somehow, a moment later everyone of us reached to a conclusion and elected Chest No. - 1 to narrate the story, which he did pretty nicely.

Since we were the first group, the wait was even longer. At this point, I was feeling pretty dejected. I had not done my absolute best in OIR, my story was not that ground breaking but most importantly because our Group Discussion was not up-to the mark. It was a chaos man! I was not even sure that the accessors got to even hear my points in the discussion. At that point, I pretty much made up my mind that I would not be selected. It was hard. I had so much dreams and expectations, I was utterly dejected. And the wait made this even worse. Anyhow, we were given a package again as lunch. When I opened it, I found drum-roll only Puri! Dude, I kid you not, my expectation were low but holy cow! Only Puri? There I was dejected by my performance, and the lunch turned out to be bad too. But no, this doesn’t end here. My misery was compounded when I found that there was actually a pretty decent Aloo ki Sabzi inside the package, I just didn’t found it earlier. So basically, I had eaten 4 Puris out of 5 completely dry and ate the last Puri alone with the Sabzi.

The results were finally out. However remember how I dejected I was? Yeah, I didn’t even feel my heartbeat go up.

Chest No. 1, Chest No. 4, Chest No. 5, Chest No. 7, (See I told you na that the first sub-group was on another level) Chest No. 9, And then Chest No. 11 Boy, I couldn’t comprehend what the heck just happened. In a daze I called out my Name and DOB and then carried my luggage to a different area where other screened-in candidates were standing. Our luggage was sanitised and then we were made to stand in another area. A total of 83 candidates got screened-in from 223. 67 were from NDA and the rest from AFCAT. We were given exactly a minute to call our parents and tell them about the result. After that our luggage was scanned extremely carefully. Then we were made to sit again in a hangar and the Wait started again.

I was given Chest No. - 6 this time. From our initial group of 14, 6 were screened-in which I think was the best ratio in all the groups. We were allotted a steel plate, a cup and a hanger, and escorted to our room in groups of 8. As soon as we entered our room, closed the door, boy we started cussing and laughing. A huge burden was off from our shoulders as for the next 4 days at least, we are staying here dude. We selected beds according to our preference. Initially all of us were silent and were just waiting for others to speak. Finally Chest No. - 7, from Sainik School, just said out loud Macho (if you know you know) and introduced himself. Soon, all of us became kinda free and it felt like we knew each other for years. In our group in increasing order of their Chest No.: Shashwat Shandilya, from Lucknow The short boy yet extremely ahhhh shall we say naughty 😉 Kushal, from Rohtak The extremely tall boy. The silent one. Kaushik, from Bihar From sainik school Bhuvi, dilli se hai bc This was just like me man! Our ideas were kinda similar and we became pretty good friends fuck, I don’t remember his name, repeater but still very young so in our group Dude, this one hell of a piece. I can wrote a whole post how weird this guy was 😂 Lol, its me Sahil, from Sujanpur Tira From Sainik School, this was the group clown. He was the funniest and liveliest of our group. The guy who couldn’t say a word without MC or BC 😂 Pravdeep, from Delhi as well Son of a Group Capt., was staying in a camp in Delhi where I had gone several times After our brief introduction, we did a lot of mastis. The food was well, bad, but considering it to be our first day, we thought maybe later on they would make better. That was bullshit. So that’s how my first day in 1-AFSB went by.

After reading this checkout the rest of the Posts too SSB Stories Tip Rules are made so that it could be broken boi. - Some not-recommended guy Okay so I had successfully survived my first day that is the Screening and now it was time for the psychologists to see how messed up my brain was. I will share much of Do’s and Dont’s in the psychological tests but just to let you know I am no expert. So, Lights! Camera! and Action! Morning Call it fear, call it excitement or just the fact that we had to actually sleep at 10:30 last night because of Lights Out Rules, call it whatever but the fact was that I had actually woken up at 4:30 all by myself no shit! And I am one of those guy who can’t wake up even by the loudest alarm. And it was pretty amazing dude. But that was not the craziest part. One of the Sainik school boy, Kaushik had already showered. Dude it was freaking 4:30 in February in Dehradun! It was freezing cold man. He was kinda crazy. So after carefully calculating the pros and cons of bathing we finally decided that we should probably bathe or at least pretend to bathe. There are still 4 days to go and what if the psychologist ma’am straight away reject us? 2 guys still were not convinced and considered it was better to sleep than to participate in our life-death discussion and boycotted showering right away. In retrospection, I think they were much smarter. Anyway, we got ready and with a bright smile and even brighter hope we went to have breakfast. It was shit. After much debate and experimentation we thought they had attempted to make some sort of Daliya-cum-Upma sort of thing. It looked like shit, it tasted like shit, and we treated it like shit. The poor guy who had sacrificed for the team and tasted it as our experiment-ish guy had to finish it all. We kinda left him there and went back to our room. At 6:30, it was fall-in and our temperature was checked. Our DSO came and briefed us. Finally it was time for the psych tests. The Psych Tests At 7:30 some 40 candidates were taken to the APJ Abdul Kalam Block and were made to sit in a large hall with a pretty big screen. 3 psychologists came and one of them briefed us about the general procedure of the tests. We were given a single booklet containing some 15 - 18 pages on which we had to write our answers. There was no provisions for extra sheet so you had to consider the space as well while writing, and not to overshoot yourself. There is no break in between the test. After each test, you are immediately required to move on to the next. Tip The best advice for Psych tests is to just present your true character. Anyway you won’t have enough time to shrewdly mask your character so it’s better to be True. If you for some reason don’t want to show a particular trait or something, make sure to stick to your claim throughout, even during your GTO and specially in your interview.

These pages are your standard A4 sheet paper, so you need to write your whole story in just half of the page which was not my forte at all. I am that guy who has big handwriting and even bigger stories. But this restriction actually helped me greatly. The pictures shown to us were pretty clear and not a single one was confusing or controversial. And I was at my peak that day. I was writing stories with what I would consider my best ever effort. All the stories had that action, OLQs, hero portraying a positive attitude, it was like my best ever attempt at the TATs. I don’t have the pictures and neither can I remember the stories. So sorry for that my dudes. And because of the restriction, I was able to finish all the Stories in under 4 minutes and able to carefully analyse the picture in the 30 seconds in which it was shown. I didn’t had to rush at all. It went pretty solid. Tip If you are practicing for TATs - make sure to complete your story in only half of a A4 sheet paper under 4 minutes. This would greatly enhance your speed and your creativity. Also make a pretty solid story for the blank slide. You can, of course, make one on the spot then and there, but since you have the liberty, why not make a good story and polish it and write that one for the blank slide? This way you would be able to finish your story before the 4 minute mark and like me take a short break and prepare for your WAT too. Another thing is try to avoid cliche, or overly good hero or things like that. Don’t write all the good things, that your hero is hard-working, studious blah blah instead show those qualities in your story.

I had never been able to write as many words as my friends used to make in the given time, let alone completing all of them. This was one of my weaker section. Yet as I was writing stories pretty fast, I had like a 30 sec rest before WAT which again helped me to make a head start. In our booklet, each page had a grid like structure sort of like this, S. No. Sentence Marks Tip There were 15 in each page. We were given a 15 sec break after every 15 word to flip the pages. This was by far the most crucial break ever as I quickly used to fill out whichever word I had missed. The words were your standard WAT words. Nothing much negative or controversial words. I don’t know how, but I managed to complete all the 60 Words without skipping a single one. Here and there I had to make some one liner sentence. But that was what came to my mind when I saw the word. Tip There were few repeated words, so make sure to write complementary sentences in them. Also practice writing completely writing 15 words on a A4 sheet because the spacing is pretty less for each word. You are practically allowed to write only a sentence on each word so practice writing short yet meaningful sentences. All in all, this too went surprisingly well and I was feeling pretty confident now.

I had practiced a lot for this and was pretty confident for this. However there was a severe problem here. In all the previous tests, spacing was a restriction but it never felt like a problem. However in this one, we had to again write our reaction in a very tiny space. And I am a guy who has a big ass handwriting. My speed took a toll and I had to cramp my writing to write the complete reaction to the given situation. Because of this, I was only able to do 52 SRTs. Still it was pretty good score so no worries there. Also, the no. of SRTs you attempt doesn’t really matter that much. Chest No. 7 who was recommended had actually done only 32 SRTs. Still he was recommended. So it’s better to write few yet good reactions. Tip However, this doesn’t mean you should not try to attempt all. See, each reaction has some points given. This mark would be hella important for the final merit list. So more the merrier! There were few similar SRTs in between. Some were exact copies of the previous one. So again try to make similar and complementary reactions in each of these. Writing that you would attack all the goons who is threatening the love of your life and for a similar situation elsewhere writing that you would leave her and run away is probably a bad idea and you should have a talk with the psychologist and the love of your life.

Then he explained how SD will work. Please don’t be the smart guy and try to write remaining SRT, remember only 1 Psychologist is talking, the other 2 Psychologist are paid to sit and just observe everyone. We were given 4 questions and we had to write a small paragraph on each. The question we were given were like this: SD Questions What your parents think about you? What your teachers think about you? What your friends or colleagues think about you? What you think about you and what kind of person you would like to become? Remember these questions are subject to each particular Center and SSB and not the same for every SSB. But in most cases, the questions are slight variations of this only. Since, most of the candidates know about these questions beforehand, almost everyone has the SD prepared and polished and full of ahhhhh well fake praises. The candidates know this, and the psychologist know about this too. So the SD doesn’t have that much value in the interview. Still, it is a good idea to make a SD before coming to the SSB. Thus, finally SD too went pretty good and with that our Psych test was finally over. At this point my Confidence was Sky High. I was so happy that I had not messed up anything in the psych tests that I was practically dancing man. Rest of the day We went to our room at around 1100 hrs and were completely free for the entire day. Too bad it was Corona times or else we would have been allowed to go outside the campus. Still we had a great time. All of us had became quite a good friends and did a lot of mastis that day. At first we were kinda serious and had 2 full on “kill-each-other” type discussion in the name of practice for our Group Discussion next day. It was pretty stimulating though and kinda scary when a 6'2\" guy is making a karate chop gesture whenever you disagree with him lmao. After about a hour we thought screw this and considered Lunch to be more important. Remember we had not anything since last night 2000 hrs and thought maybe, just maybe the Mess would finally figure out how to make a decent lunch. Yeah that was kinda wrong to assume. We were so hungry that we actually went inside the mess. We were politely send back. Finally at around 1300 hrs we were given lunch, which shall we say was kind of decent or maybe it was because bat shit hungry and would have eaten the Mess Boy too if he would have been enough salted. After this only thing remained was to wait for our finally much awaited Game Time. We were so excited for this that we didn’t even sleep at all and spend the entire afternoon playing dumb-charades, cricket with kinnu, and some other dumb shits which would be kinda inappropriate to write here 😉.

Due to the Covid, each group was allotted a particular game for a particular time frame only. Balls and other things could be issued from the game room. There was a strict No intermixing between groups Rule. I was probably in some dream world when this rule was stated. Maybe. See, we were allotted volleyball for 1 hour and football for the next hour. And I hate these sports from the bottom of my heart. I also happen to love Basketball. And I am kind of pretty Stupid too. So when we 8 boys with bright eyes and eager mind with lots of energy finally went to the volleyball court and started playing, I found out I was kind of shit in this game. Which didn’t particularly helped my hatred for the game. Sometime later, few candidates came and joined our group and started playing with us. And some started playing Basketball too. You see where this is going? Yeah, we thought if they can join us, we can join others too. The rule felt really stupid after all. So here Chest No. 8 and I made the brilliant decision and started playing basketball. Boy oh boy! it was the best game of my life. We were rolling man. 10 guys passionately playing basketball. It was amazing. Added to the fact that I am pretty decent in basketball and was playing top of my game. Lmao, we were so engrossed that we didn’t even notice the utter silence around us. I happen to look at the volleyball court and saw that a Duty Officer was what looked like scolding our group members and other who were playing with them. Blood turned cold, fear was practically pouring out of our body instead of sweat man. We immediately stopped our game. And being the Smarty-pants I am, I tried to sneak away and pretend that I was not even playing. You see, the basketball court was in a cage and the only way to enter or exit was through a single gate which was right in front of the eyes of the officer. So yeah, my plan didn’t worked though and the officer shouted and told us to remain there only. He came and asked what we were doing and why we were not with our group. We tried to explain things but he probably thought we were bullshitting and asked the NCO with him to write our Chest Numbers and told us to go back to our rooms. It was like a scene of mourning in the room. Or maybe that was just me, since the others were actually playing their allotted game only albeit breaking the covid protocols. And the guy who was with me Chest No. 8 didn’t really wanted to be an Officer and had come to the SSB because his father told him (his father was Wg Cdr in Air Force) so he basically didn’t care at all. So there I was from being the most happy and confident guy to jack-shit scared thinking I would be expelled next day only during the fall-in or even worse, the accessors and the psychologists would make a negative remark on me and not recommend me. Yeah I was pretty much bummed up through that night. We kind of did a small discussion practice and called it a day and slept before even 2200 hrs. Lmao don’t get so much depressed guys, we talked to that same NCO later on our 4th day and found that he had thrown that paper right away and they never told any psychologist or even our DSO. It was just to instil fear in us and to make us follow the Covid protocols. I would say that certainly did the trick, ummm kind of too much even because no one, not even the repeaters broke any rule later on. So that was how my second day in the SSB went. I was pretty confident at this point and thought I would surely get recommended. Do read about the rest of the experience here SSB Stories. Checkout - Day 1 \u0026 Day 3 Peace.

However, Pakistan reoccupied its outposts way earlier. And not only this, they began sending “soldiers” across the LoC and infiltrated India’s own outposts. Warning I wrote them as “soldiers” because Pakistan to this date denies any involvement in the war and claims they were “Mujahideen” and “Kashmiri Freedom Fighters”. This is a clear lie by Pakistan as it has contradicted its own statements numerous times. Troops from the elite Special Services Group as well as four to seven battalions of the Northern Light Infantry (a paramilitary regiment not part of the regular Pakistani army at that time) covertly and overtly set up bases on 132 vantage points of the Indian-controlled region. According to some reports, these Pakistani forces were backed by Kashmiri guerrillas and Afghan mercenaries. According to General Ved Malik, the bulk of the infiltration occurred in April. Finally in the starting of the month of May, when Pakistan had infiltrated deep inside LoC, a local shepherd saw them and found them suspicious and informed the Army. Indian Army sent a patrol team on his tip. Those 5 brave soldiers were captured and brutally killed by the terrorist. Army initially considered them as a small intrusion, and said they would evict them in just few days. How very wrong they were.

The large difference in the number of troops in the Indian (30,000) vs Pakistan’s (5,000) was due to the fact that these hills effectively acted as a natural fort and 6:1 number of soldiers are required to attack and to defend respectively.

This was soon followed by the Batalik-Turtok sub-sector which provided access to Siachen Glacier. Some of the peaks that were of vital strategic importance to the Pakistani defensive troops were Point 4590 and Point 5353. While 4590 was the nearest point that had a view of NH 1, point 5353 was the highest feature in the Dras sector, allowing the Pakistani troops to observe NH 1. Capturing Hills\" Capturing Hills The recapture of Point 4590 by Indian troops on 14 June was significant, but it also resulted in the Indian Army suffering the most casualties in a single battle during the conflict. Once India regained control of the hills overlooking NH 1, the Indian Army turned to driving the invading force back across the LOC. Some of the posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point 5140) that fell only later in the war. Indian troops found well-entrenched Pakistani soldiers at Tiger Hill, and both sides suffered heavy casualties.

IAF was not involved at all in the beginning and it was only on 26th May, that IAF got the permission to attack. However, IAF Chief Air Chief Marshal AY Tipnis was strictly forbidden by the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee to not cross the LoC at any cost. IAF immediately started their attack codenamed Operation Safed Sagar. However, due to severe lack of intelligence about the weapons that the enemy had, IAF suffered huge losses intially. Initial Losses IAF conducted initial air strikes on the enemy position near LoC using its MiG Fleet on 27th May. Flt. Lt. Nachiketa’s MiG-27 crashed due to an Engine Failure. He ejected and landed in enemy land and was soon captured and given the PoW (Prisoner of War) status. He was paraded on live Pakistani TV mocking IAF and India and violating Geneva Convention and released 6 days later. However, Wg Cdr Ajay Ahuja who was leading the air strike, remained there to look for Nachiketa knowing full well about the risk of getting hit by the Pakistani Missiles. His MiG-21 too was shot down by an Stinger Shoulder fired missile and he ejected. However, he didn’t survived. His post mortem showed he had two point-blank bullet shots near his ear and chest, a cold blooded murder by Pakistani soldiers. Pakistan however denies this clear breaking of Geneva Convention. On the very next day, one Mi-17 was also shot down killing all the 4 crewmembers aboard (2 Officers and 2 Airmen). Thus as a measure against enemy’s Man-Portable Air-Defense-System (MANPADS), IAF recalled all its attack helicopters and used their helicopter for reconnaissance and providing cover fire only. Total Air Dominance However, after the initial losses, IAF enjoyed almost total dominance over the skies and received no resistance from PAF. Starting from May 30, recently bought Mirage 2000 was inducted in the war. They were equipped with Laser-Guided Bombs (LGB) as well as 250 Kg “Dumb” Bombs (Unguided). However, their “Dumb” bombs were so effective that only 9 LGB were fired in the whole war.

Tip Here is a cool article about the marvel of these Mirage 2000 in this war. All aircraft operated at an altitude of 9-10,000 metres, (~30-33,000 feet above sea level), diving when required and pulling out well out of MANPADs range with no further losses except the initial ones.

The Indian Navy’s western and eastern fleets joined in the North Arabian Sea and began aggressive patrols and threatened to cut Pakistan’s sea trade. This exploited Pakistan’s dependence on sea-based oil and trade flows. Later, then–Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif disclosed that Pakistan was left with just six days of fuel to sustain itself if a full-scale war had broken out. Thus, on 26th July 1999, Indian Army declared that all intruders were evicted and concluded the war. 26th July is celebrated as the Vijay Diwas to remember our soldier’s sacrifice and celebrate India’s win. Background Every war just doesn’t happen on its own. Several complicated and seemingly unrelated issues results in a war like situation. Let’s look at the Geo-Political situation at that time. This mastermind behind this attack codenamed Operation Badr was General Pervez Musharraf who was appointed Pakistan’s Army Chief only in Oct 1998. This was stab-in-the-back attack as PM Vajpayee was trying to improve India-Pakistan relation and had went to Pakistan recently in Feb 99 to sign the Lahore Declaration. Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif claimed that he didn’t have any information about it and came to know about this attack only through Vajpayee’s Urgent phone call. He said that the entire plan was known to only 4 Generals including General Musharraf. Pakistan had conducted their first Nuclear test in 1998 and thus General Musharraf may have assumed that both countries having nuclear power (India had conducted Nuclear test in secret in 1974 and in 1998) would not escalate into full-blown open war and this conflict would help in completing their motives. General Musharraf removed PM Nawaz Sharif after a boodless coup and gained power after the war in Oct 99.

But most of the other function are called like this len(variable), str(variable). What’s the difference? Actually, the first set of examples are actually called attributes or methods. Let’s take the example of lower(), which acts on the str datatype. str datatype is actually a class and has a number of functions inside it. These functions are called attribute and can be accessed by using the . notation. class Hello: def world(self): print(\"Hello World\") hello = Hello() # Instantiate the class Hello hello.world() # Access the attribute world() # Prints: Hello World Refresh your OOP If you are familiar with OOP programming, this is all very familiar to you. If not, you can read more here. So, back to our example: string = \"Hello World\" print(string.lower()) # Here, I have called string's (str class) # attribute lower() which changes case to # lowercase l = [1, 3, 2] l.sort() # Here, sort() is an attribute of l # (list datatype) which sorts the list Tip Thus, lower() and sort() are actually functions inside the str and list class respectively On the other hand, the latter examples were all functions, like your normal def func() thing. They perform a certain task on the argument that is passed to them. The task may or may not be unique to a particular datatype. string = \"Hello World\" l = [1, 2, 3] print(len(string)) # Prints the no. of characters in string # (str datatype) print(len(l)) # Notice, len() can be applied to list # datatype (and various other types) too I hope you leaned something new today 😄.

Worry not 😄, I will try to explain it as simply as I can in this post. What is defer? A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns. The deferred call’s arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns. This program explains the execution of defer in a bit easier way: func trace(s string) string { fmt.Println(\"entering:\", s) return s } func un(s string) { fmt.Println(\"leaving:\", s) } func a() { defer un(trace(\"a\")) // similarly trace(\"a\") also gets // executed immediately fmt.Println(\"in a\") } func b() { defer un(trace(\"b\")) // trace(\"b\") gets executed // immediately but un(\"b\") gets // execute at the very last fmt.Println(\"in b\") a() } func main() { b() } Output: entering: b // output of trace(\"b\") in b // note that un(\"b\") is not executed instead // program moves ahead entering: a // output of trace(\"a\") in a leaving: a // finally defered un(\"a\") is called as a() // returns leaving: b // at last un(\"b\") is called Tip Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack. When a function returns, its deferred calls are executed in last-in-first-out order. Here is a small program which visualises this: package main import \"fmt\" func main() { fmt.Println(\"counting \\n\") defer fmt.Println(\"\\ndone\") // This will get executed at // the very last for i := 0; i \u003c 10; i++ { defer fmt.Println(i) } } Output: counting 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 done However remember deferred function’s arguments are evaluated immediately, hence it can give a different result i := 0 defer fmt.Println(i) i++ // It will print 0 even though i has become 1 A particularly good use of defer is to close a file. package main import ( \"os\" ) func main() { f, _ := os.Create(\"test.txt\") defer f.Close() /* Stuff */ } Abstract Deferring a call to a function such as Close has two advantages. First, it guarantees that you will never forget to close the file, a mistake that’s easy to make if you later edit the function to add a new return path. Second, it means that the close sits near the open, which is much clearer than placing it at the end of the function.

Rajat Gupta Starting with a small intro of this short experience, I am a 17-year-old boy and I went to 4-AFSB Varanasi for my NDA-146 SSB. I know I am a bold and positive minded guy and mentally fit for armed forces (Lol working on physical fitness as well) My short experience consist of listed parts: Preparation Reporting at the centre. Screening test. Preparation: Starting from the beginning, when I was in class 11th I didn’t knew much about armed forces and how to get selected as an officer in the forces, though my father is in Air Force but still. A good friend of mine Avaneesh, who is fully oriented toward armed forces, and from him I got to know about NDA, later I watched some videos and considered to join forces if given a chance (ironically I blundered and missed the opportunity) but I had to wait for a long time for it and then NDA (II) - 146 written forms were out so I filled the form at the earliest, the exam was scheduled at 6th of sept 2020 and I started preparation on 5th Lol. As the well known pandemic is going on and none of us having same centre and I had to travel 400 Km for the exam. We booked a private car and went for the exam. As I am good in maths I was able to qualify the exam easily and got a decent mark 420. Then after the result I registered in army website and did a mistake and mentioned wrong email-id, that’s why army website couldn’t recognise me, but later it was corrected. I am in constant talk with Avaneesh about the procedure and purchased some books for help as well. Then as both NDA(I) and NDA(II) papers were held together so our SSBs were delayed by 2-3 months. On December 22nd I met some old friends of Avaneesh through Skype and started preparing with them. We practised PPDT (picture perception and discussion test) followed by WAT and sometimes SRT and fortnightly some healthy discussions and interview. On 12th of January I got mail from Indian Army and filled my SSB dates as 22nd February 2020 knowing the fact that JEE mains exams were to be held from 24th of February. By consistently preparing I was pretty confident that I could get screened in easily (Lol remember this line). Now let me tell you what happen in between the scenes, I got to know about medicals and watched some videos related to it I checked everything and found nothing defected (knock knees, pigeon chest, flat foot) and I was happy with it but life is not that kind for me once I (honestly, not me my mom noticed it) that my chest are not symmetrical (same). On left side of lower rib, its like an extended bone, I checked this thing to a doctor and even he was not able to find the cause, I put my hands on it and tried to feel what caused this thing but not able to find out and know that I am not physically fit for armed forces but may be it is a 50-50 chance as it is from birth and till now I have no problem with this. At that time I was thinking that I am wasting my time by preparing for SSB and I should focus on JEE but on the other hand I took the call just opposite to what I was thinking (its my habit I always think with my heart but take decisions with my mind XD) not for SSB but for my friends, my respect, if I quit in between the preparation it will not only waste my time but also of them also, and quitting tasks in between is not a job of an officer. I watched videos and did consistent exercise to make myself perfect, then comes the day of leaving for my first SSB. Reporting in Centre: Reaching the centre was much more difficult and exciting task for me as Varanasi was about 2000 Km from my residence. I took a bus from Ludhiana to Delhi at 1400 hrs and got to know bus will start at 1500 hrs. My train was scheduled at 2250 hrs and I calculated the travel time as 6 hrs for Delhi and then 1 hrs to railway station from Kashmiri Gate but I totally forgot about farmer protest, it may took more than 1 hr to reach delhi and I was so tensed because it was possible that I might miss the t","date":"2021-04-01","objectID":"/posts/ssb/afsb-varanasi/:0:0","tags":["SSB","Air Force","NDA"],"title":"AFSB Varanasi","uri":"/posts/ssb/afsb-varanasi/"},{"categories":["art"],"content":"This art was actually for my Chemistry teacher.

I finally realized people are actually prisoners of their own phones that is why they are called cell phones. Very Good morning one and all present here.

There is this girl of 16 years who is given 2500 rupees as pocket money by her parents each month. But do you know my friend where she spent all her money? She blew all her money in recharging her Smartphone. She no longer communicates with the family, her phone has to be beside her day and night, she often talk from the early hours of the morning to late in the night, her homework is suffering ,her health is deteriorating and worst of all she considers no other activity or hobby worthy of her time or pocket money. This, my friend is not any piece of my friend rather it is the ugly truth of today’s generation. The truth is, we all are cyborgs with cell phones and online identities. It should come as no surprise that smartphones and tablets have now replaced basketballs and baby dolls on a child’s wish list. Elementary school-aged children start asking, or let’s say begging, for these forms of technology before they can even tie their shoes.

They cause depression and could even affect their mood and concentration in studies. They can cause diseases like cancer, tumour in the brain, as well as hearing impairment in children. They can also be called a reason for a child’s hyperactivity or attention deficiency. Conclusion Your cell phone has already replaced the camera, calendar, watch, flash light and your alarm clock.

It is about eliminating the gender stereotypes. “A gender-equal society would be one where the word ‘gender’ is not much relevant, where everyone can be themselves.” Does Empowerment Of Girls, Dis-empower The Boys? “When God created man and woman, he was thinking, ‘Who shall I give the power to, to give birth to the next human being?’ And God chose woman. And this is the big evidence that girls are powerful.” But what about boys? Are they not important? Are they not worthy? Will anyone ever take a stand for boys? Introduction Very Good morning one and all present here. Admirable Judges, Esteemed distinguished guests and all my beneficiary students present here. I am Lucifer Chase, presenting today a very inspirable, debatable, young mind ignited and burning topic “Does Empowerment of Girls, Dis-empower the Boys” March 8 marked International women’s Day, a celebration of girls worldwide that dates back to 1977 when the UN General Assembly challenged its members to declare a day for girl’s rights and world peace. On this day from social media to television, everything is flooded with catchy slogans and messages on empowering girls. But I ask you my friend do you even know when is international men’s day? It is on 19th of November. But the point is why does not it create the same hype and the same enthusiasm? It is because we don’t even think of empowering boys because we think they are the alpha of this society and don’t need it. But is it so my friend? Post 21st century the table has been flipped. Today girls have numerous rights in her favour and why wouldn’t they have? Girls are also equal. But the problem is while empowering girls we have completely left out boys from the equation itself. Let me tell you a story first. When I was in Kindergarten our class had decided to perform a play in the annual function. Our teacher asked us which character they want to perform. Many girls requested to play a male character. Our teacher appreciated it very much and gave them a bar of chocolate each. Inspired by this when my turn came I requested a female character for my innocent self back then. And instead of appreciating me the whole class laughed at me. Have you seen the difference? It has become commonplace to tell our daughters they can be anything they want: tomboy, doctor, mother, lawyer or soldier. But we’re less apt to do that for our sons, who we discourage from choices that are considered feminine. Boys are critically judged and assessed - by themselves, by their peers, by their elders and by most girls themselves - based on the dominant ideals of manhood. And across many societies, this still means being tough, being strong. It also means achieving something, as terms such as “man-up” suggest, and many boys, including low-income boys, struggle with this societal expectation. If boys can’t achieve and don’t conform to these societal expectations, they are often socially sanctioned, belittled or ridiculed. Challenging norms and behaviours is thus a collective challenge for boys. It is also a challenge for girls, who consciously or unconsciously often perpetuate these same social norms in the way they raise their sons or interact with boys. We must empower Boys and Girls. Of course, not in the conventional sense by giving boys more power over girls or favouring girls more. Rather, by empowering boys to challenge prevailing norms and change their behaviours. Girl empowerment must not mean not letting girls play with dolls. It simply means that dolls are just one of the many things girls can play with. Similarly, it must not scoff at boys who play with dolls. This is logical even though it has not been the prevailing approach. Gender is a “system” and both girls and boys are integral parts of this system. If we want to see meaningful change, both boys and girls are implicated. It is not enough to enlighten and empower girls and expect boys to follow. Conclusion Let’s change our dialogue.

Introduction The fact that there is today an India to think, talk and know is in my opinion very largely due to Sardar Patel’s statesmanship and firm administration. In this modern time of Superheroes and fiction, we too had our own Iron Man in our country. Our very own Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the man who united our nation. But what was his vision, idea, dream about the future of India? Have we truly made India of the dreams of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel? Vallabhbhai Patel was born in Nadiad, Gujarat, on October 31, 1875.

Therefore in his dreams he would have always imagined of a India that was united. He even said that Every citizen of India must remember that he is an Indian and he has every right in this country but with certain duties.

His faith in institutional mechanisms like having an organized command based army and a systematised bureaucracy proved to be a blessing.” Thus he spoke of a India with a strong civil service force to run our country. Conclusion Thus he dreamt of a India which was utterly united. There should be no divisions between us in this India of Sardar Patel.Today we must remove distinctions of high and low, rich and poor, caste or creed. Because these rather than doing any good for us causes a hindrance in our road to glory. Our India should independent and self-relied rather than depending on others for help. Then only can we become successful. Concluding with the words of The Iron man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel We worked hard to achieve our freedom; we shall have to strive harder to justify it.

I make mistakes, I am out of control \u0026 at times hard to handle. Introduction Very Good morning one and all present here. Admirable Judges, Esteemed distinguished guests and all my beneficiary students present here. I am Lucifer Chase presenting today a very inspirable, debatable, young mind ignited and burning topic of the time - to choose between academics Marks vs Emotional stability. My dear audience! First of all ask yourself, how many of you are not oriented towards scoring good marks in academics? How many of you are selected for your higher education not because of your higher marks but for your emotional stable personality in academics? I am sure all of you will have a big no as your answer. But I ask you why? Why are we still running behind marks and not toward ensuring emotional stability? Why are there hundreds of thousands of coaching classes for securing high marks but very few for emotional stability? Because marks still hold more priority than emotional stability. But first of all what is emotional stability? Meaning Emotional stability refers to a person’s ability to remain stable and balanced. It means having a composed behaviour, for both success and failure. It is the ability to control his or her emotional expressions. But on the other hand “Marks” are indicators of knowledge, on a subject studied. Without marks there is no objective for testing the knowledge. Now let me tell you a story. Imagine there are 2 students one who is exceptionally intelligent and the other remains calm even during distribution of test papers. He knows that marks are not as important as knowledge and don’t worry much about tests. And thus the intelligent child scored more than the calm child. But when it came to jobs the intelligent child was easily hired with a good pay. But on the other hand the calm child struggled to find a decent job and was paid far less. As you can see when you need to hire a person for a job and to select professional courses in the college university level - you cannot interview each and every person to discover each person’s level of knowledge. The first and foremost indicator of a person is his academic marks. And what use is emotional stability when it could not land a good job. Today the world has become very competitive. Competition is everywhere. It is in studies, sports, job and almost all activities of mankind. In today’s world even if you are emotionally and mentally stable but lack marks in your grade sheet then congratulations my friend you are in the bottom of the well and least likely to succeed. Better marks in school now means better emotional stability as an adult when you don’t have to worry about finding a job, or feeding your family, or having enough money to buy gas so you can drive to school or the office. But if you do not succeed well in school and college then most of you will lead a very frustrated and bad life. Conclusion For me, presently both Marks and Emotional stability is utmost important. But if I was given a choice then I would wholeheartedly accept marks because right I am just a student. With better marks I can easily be emotionally stable but only emotional stability cannot help me. At the last I am sure, putting hard work on studies with healthy emotional stability I can get Full Marks in terms of Knowledge based in my future endeavours to make myself, my family, my school and my nation proud. Thank you.
