**Place**: 1-AFSB Dehradun\
**Date**: 08 Feb 2021\
**Batch**: D-NDA/FTS-F(P)(M)/497\
**Result**: Conference Out

# Introduction

Due to COVID-19, our NDA exam got delayed and instead of the usual 2 times a year procedure, both the exams were held on the same day, but were counted for 2 different SSBs.

I cleared the cutoff for both the SSBs but I was not eligible (due to age) for the 1st SSB (which was at 2-AFSB Mysore).\
I went for the 2nd SSB which was at 1-AFSB Dehradun on 8th Feb 2021.

Read, all the crazy experiences that I had in the SSB, the mistakes that I did which you can avoid and bits and pieces of advice that I have to share.
