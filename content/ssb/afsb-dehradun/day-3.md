  Day - 3. This was the day that didn't go at all well for me. I made few blunders, few mistakes and shot my confidence down. Read my mistakes so you won't do the same.

First of all, a big Sorry!\
I had not been able to post anything for the past few months due to various other things holding me up ~(>\_<„ÄÇ)Ôºº. But I promise, I will be more regular now (hopefully ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ ).

This blog owing to its length is divided into 5 posts, each in detail description of my 5 day experience in the SSB. After reading this checkout the rest of the Posts too [All 1-AFSB Dehradun by Me](/ssb/afsb-dehradun/all-days).\

Part of why I was not motivated to write this (apart from nobody reading these üòê) was because, this was the day, when I completely messed up my chances at the SSB. I was doing so well, but when I was not able to perform in one or two tasks, I thought "Welp! Looks like its time to pack my bags cause I am a stupid-ass failure!" and let my confidence go down so much, I was not able to perform good later on.

Big mistake. Don't let that happen to you ever!

Anyway, let's start today's journey with full Steam ahead, my fellow candidates!

Lights, Camera, Action!

# Morning

As usual, we woke up before 4:30. Did our morning rituals (and no it didn't mean sacrificing our fellow candidates to the NDA Gods).

Partaking my fellow room-mates divine wisdom, I decided to be a good citizen and not waste the life-giver, the cradle of civilisation, the divine fluid, the holy *water*. What I mean to say is I too skipped bathing and went back to sleep.

Probably that was a bad idea.

Anyway, at this point of time we had no faith in the Mess food, but still hoping against hope, three of us went to see what is there in the menu, under the condition that only I will put food in my plate and if it was even mildly good, all of us would eat that.

Another bad idea right there.

As you can imagine, my friends disappeared faster than I could say "Hey, what about our plan?". And since we can't throw food (sure you can do that, but after seeing the cheery mess uncle's face, you just can't.), I had to eat all the food that was supposed to be for all of us. Not cool!

At 6:30 it was fall-in time. Our temperatures were checked and the DSO briefed us about today's plan.

{{< admonition type=abstract title="Fun Story" open=true >}}
So, in our first day, after our screen-in, we were waiting in the same hangar to fill our PIQ forms and other guidelines that the DSO wanted to brief us. However, we were delayed for at least 10 - 15 minutes, because some guy was missing after our bathroom breaks. After waiting for like 10 minutes, seeing the DSO getting really frustrated (he will never show this, but you can obviously infer this), it was found that the guy was roaming and came back pretty chilled.

Bad luck was in store for him!\
The DSO didn't said much to him that day. However, his interview was arranged on the third day itself (even before the repeaters! while he was a fresher like us).

So guys, don't bring much attention towards yourself, or you could too end up like him.

# The GTO

We were taken to the same place where our PPDT was conducted. In a building, we were divided into groups of eight and taken to a room similar to others.

In the room, there was a big something in the middle but it was covered with a black cloth. There were chairs in a semicircle around the object while three chairs were there for the GTO (1 in front and two in either corners in back).

## Before the tasks

Soon, the GTO came. A smart fellow with those typical Ray-Ban Glasses. He introduced himself (didn't gave us any name or rank). He then asked us to introduce ourself by stating our name and a hobby.

After a bit of chit-chat, where he made us a very comfortable, gave few advices and explained the basic working of the tasks.

## Group Discussion-I
