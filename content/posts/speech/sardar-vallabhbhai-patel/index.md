Manpower without unity is not a strength unless it is harmonized and united properly, then it becomes a spiritual power.

# Introduction

The fact that there is today an India to think, talk and know is in my opinion very largely due to Sardar Patel's statesmanship and firm administration. In this modern time of Superheroes and fiction, we too had our own Iron Man in our country. Our very own Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the man who united our nation. But what was his vision, idea, dream about the future of India? Have we truly made India of the dreams of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel?

**Vallabhbhai Patel** was born in Nadiad, Gujarat, on October 31, 1875. He hailed from a poor farmer's family. After independence Patel became the deputy Prime Minister of India.And thus India was revolutionized by Patel's vision and efficiency.

# The Indian Dream

In my opinion, Patel probably dreamt of a India which should be

## United
Perhaps the greatest service that he did to our country was to unite it.In what was to become Sardar Patel's most lasting legacy, he took charge of the States Department and was responsible for the integration of 565 princely states into the Union of India.He rewrote India into one single marvellous country. Therefore in his dreams he would have always imagined of a India that was united. He even said that Every citizen of India must remember that he is an Indian and he has every right in this country but with certain duties.

## Independent
All his life Patel toiled for only for one thing that India should be Independent. It should not be depended on anyone for anything. Then only it would prosper. In his own words he said and I quote,

{{< admonition type=quote title="Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel" open=true >}}
My only desire is that India should be a good producer and no one should be hungry, shedding tears for food in the country.
{{< /admonition >}}

He dreamt of an India which could satisfy its own needs without begging anyone.

## Economically Stable
In addition, Sardar Patel was favourable for private enterprises, as opposed to the public sector favoured by Nehru. Self-Reliance was among the chief tenets of Patel's economic philosophy.He wanted to see India industrialize quickly. His views on Indian business were just appropriate for modern India today.

## Powerful
In Patel's opinion a country needed a strong military force to keep it protected internally as well as externally.Patel conceptualized some of the greatest policies to keep our country secured from border countries' attack.

## Strong Civil Services
Patel was clearly conscious of the fact that independent India needed "a steel frame to run its civil, military, and administrative bureaucracy. His faith in institutional mechanisms like having an organized command based army and a systematised bureaucracy proved to be a blessing." Thus he spoke of a India with a strong civil service force to run our country.

# Conclusion

Thus he dreamt of a India which was utterly united. There should be no divisions between us in this India of Sardar Patel.Today we must remove distinctions of high and low, rich and poor, caste or creed. Because these rather than doing any good for us causes a hindrance in our road to glory. Our India should independent and self-relied rather than depending on others for help. Then only can we become successful.

Concluding with the words of The Iron man

We worked hard to achieve our freedom; we shall have to strive harder to justify it.

Jai Hind, Jai Bharat
