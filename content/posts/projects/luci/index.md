{{< admonition type=failure title="Project Abandoned" open=true >}}
Development for this awesome bot had to be stopped due to some personal reasons.

The original library on which this was based [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) was scrapped - [The Future of discord.py](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1), due to lack of support from Discord Devs ðŸ˜ž.
